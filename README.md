# Bad Apple but it is played in the Terminal

Here is a Demo [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/_JTHbbsSCZk).

## Steps to run

### `npm install`

Installs the required dependecies.

### `npm run extract`

Extracts the video file into an image sequence.

### `npm run build`

Reads the image sequence and generates `data.txt` containing the frames converted into text.

### `npm start`

Plays the video in the console. Enjoy!

Note: If you want to play it again, run `npm start`. You dont have to run the other commands, unless you delete the `data.txt` file.
